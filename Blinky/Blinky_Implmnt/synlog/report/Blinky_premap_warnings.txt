@W: MT529 :"c:\users\kolel\onedrive\lattice fpga\blinky\main.v":7:0:7:5|Found inferred clock blinky|clk which controls 25 sequential elements including counter[0:23]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
